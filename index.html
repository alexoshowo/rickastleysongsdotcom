            <h3>Lyrics</h3>
            <p>
            We're no strangers to love <br>
            You know the rules and so do I<br>
            A full commitment's what I'm thinkin' of<br>
            You wouldn't get this from any other guy<br>
            I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling<br>
            Gotta make you understand<br>
            Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
            Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
            We've known each other for so long<br>
            Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it<br>
            Inside, we both know what's been going on<br>
            We know the game and we're gonna play it<br>
            And if you ask me how I'm feeling<br>
            Don't tell me you're too blind to see<br>
            Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
            Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
            Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down<br>
            Never gonna run around and desert you<br>
            Never gonna make you cry, never gonna say goodbye<br>
            Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br>
            </p>
